Title: A list of sources of university-level online courses
slug: online-courses
<markdown>
I have recently been looking at some courses online, and thought, hey, there's gotta be a list *somewhere*, right? Apparently, there isn't. I scoured Hacker News, and I tried searching Reddit (though its topology is so vast it's daunting). Nothing good turned up.

### What this is
The following list is ordered roughly by amount and quality of courses. You first get aggregators, then sites of individual universities, then sites of smaller universities, and finally single courses of interest that I stumbled across. The single courses being here is not the result of some cream of the crop selection, I just came across them while searching for bigger results.

Anyway, I hope you guys have fun using and abusing this resource. I decided to use URLs only, because they're usually easier to identify than many of the stupid titles the sites on this list have.

Please make sure to comment and tell me if you know any good resources I have missed. Also hang out on [irc.freenode.net #codez](irc://irc.freenode.net/#codez) ([Freenode webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=codez)) which is a social place for students, people interested in technology, etc. I hope to get some chat going there related to the courses, this way we can figure out what's best.

### Education revised
I am very happy that it's possible to reach such amazing content on the web. I remember when I first heard of MIT OCW — I immediately started browsing, unfortunately both my computer and internet connection at the time sucked so much I was unable to use any of it. Nowadays I can wake up and, while getting out of my bed, eating breakfast, packing for the gym, and grooming, all the time watch Susskind talk about general relativity. I can really immerse myself in study if I want to, and this is great. Studying would have been so much easier had I had this resource in the past! I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't find any good resources with video lecutres in Russian — there are many legendary lectures in mathematics and physics, for example, being given at russian universities. Hopefully time will change that.

### Posterous fucking sucks it down yet again.
I have had to remove the http prefix from youtube links, otherwise Posterous would spill its fucking guts trying incorrectly to make a video player out of them. I didn't get any reply from the help email address, as usual, in contrast to how Posterous firm themselves as user friendly. I only figured out later that I could put in an url without the http prefix and it would get mutilated into an anchor link without getting mutilated by the player misfeature. You suck, Posterous. Any suggestions for a better blog host? I just need markdown and image hosting.. although the image hosting in Posterous is useless, too.
